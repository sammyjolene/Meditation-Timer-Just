#Create a simple meditation timer that will allow you to input a time and add in interval chimes if you want them.
#input 1 = meditation_length = equals that total length of the meditation session
#input 2 = interval_length = the length between each sound, if you leave it blank it will default to meditation_length
#Function: Entering the number will start a time that will count down on screen (when I have a front-end) 
##and make a sound at the end of session. It will also make a sound at each time interval if one was input

#stage 1 -- create the coundown with a sound playing every minute - COMPLETE
#stage 2 -- allow a user to input the interval that the sound is played - COMPLETE
